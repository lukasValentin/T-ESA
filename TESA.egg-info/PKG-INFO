Description: # TESA
        
        This is a short descritpion of how to use the T-ESA (Twitter-Easy Sentiment Analysis)
        package for conducting some sentiment analysis using a lexicon based approach.
        
        Per **Default** the Hu and Liu lexicon is used (Hu & Liu, 2004; Liu et al., 2005).
        However, users can also provide other lexicons as text-files (one for positive words
        and one for negative ones).
        
        Please see the provided example for more details.
        
        The package works on single tweets that are expected to be provided as string variable.
        It is capable of:
        
        - cleaning the tweet (stop word and special character removal using a given list)
        
        - using the Porter-Stemmer or a lemmanization routine (both taken from the nltk package) to ensure better matching betweens the words in the tweets and the lexicon
        
        - simple negation handling
        
        **How to use it:**
        
        Some example Python code can be found in the /example directory of the Python package
        that shows the usage of the API
        
        As almost mentioned you will have to install the nltk Python package as well.
